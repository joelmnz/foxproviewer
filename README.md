# foxproviewer
A foxpro query tool for viewing data and executing sql queries on a foxpro database.

Supports select statements into a grid (multi selects in 1 statement will return multiple result grids) and all other valid sql statements (insert, delte, update).

vfpoledb (foxpro oledb) driver required.

Created as a quick zero depandancy tool I could take with my on usb or share over a cloud folder to look at and manipulate foxpro data.
